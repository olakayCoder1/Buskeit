# Buskeit ( Backend-django) 
Buskeit is an application for school bus fleet management. Currently, parents are asked to sign a 
book when their wards are picked up from the house. Buskeit intends to take out the manual process signing of
this book and digitize it. With buskeit, parents can acknowledge when their children have been picked up/ dropped off also.
Schools can also leverage this app for proper student administration/planning and better bus fleet tracking/management.
